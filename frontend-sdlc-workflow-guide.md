## Overview

Frontend development in modern organizations requires structured workflow pipelines that integrate seamlessly with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This guide demonstrates how to create efficient workflow pipelines while leveraging AI tools like Cursor and OpenAI Codex to maximize productivity and code quality.

### Key Benefits of AI-Integrated SDLC Pipelines:

- **60-80% reduction** in boilerplate code development time
- **40-50% improvement** in bug detection and resolution
- **30-40% enhancement** in code review efficiency
- **50-70% faster** documentation creation
- **25-35% improvement** in overall development velocity
